Supt.\"\n\"As if my family wasn't doing its\nbest,\"' she 'said.\n''Please read the postscript\nFurther light on the methods of the\nUnited Charities in \"distributing\ncharity\" and preventing \"justice\" is\ngiven in the story -of Mrs. Frank\nPeterson, 1152 West Harrison street.\nAbout eighteen months ago Frank\nPeterson was dying of tuberculosis.\nHis wife, unable to support her dying\nhusband and three little children,\nFrank, aged 9, Harold, 7, and Ruth,\n3, applied to the United Charities for\nassistance.\nThey would do nothing for her\nuntil they \"investigated.\" Several\nweeks went by. Finally they came\nand made an offer. \"Send your hus\nband to Oak Forest,\" they said, \"and\nwe will get you a mother's persion.\"\n\"Mrs. Peterson preferred to keep\nher husband at home, to give the\ndying man her personal attention, a\nwife's care. But necessity forced her\nto send him away. She had her chil\ndren. Once the husband was gone, the U.\nC. refused to do a thing for the wife.\nShe begged them for work, although\nalmost too ill to stand on her feet.\nAfter some delay they ga,ve her a\nticket for four days' work at the\nMary Crane Nursery.\n\"I was told,\" she says, \"not to tell\nthem that I was illr. I kept still, I\nneeded the money to feed my babes.\n\"I worked one day and was told not\nto return. I had done my best, but\nwas too 111 to keep up the pace set\nby the management. For nine hours'\nwork I'received $1.\"\nMrsDouthergy, 56 years old, the\nmother of Mrs. Peterson, was stop\nping with\" her daughter. She is a\nwidow and has a girl aged 12. She\nis a.hard-working woman whp sup\nports herself and child on the $6 a\nweek she earns.\nThe investigators got husy. Here\nwas a woman independent enough to\ntake care of herself and child. Too\nproud to be a recipient of charity.\nWhy not shift the responsibility?\n--. ASMt? .. 'i'v'-i'aattA\ntei",

The\nfirst witness called\nwas W. F. Love,\nwho described how\nthe fight started.\nHe stated that he\nand Peterson were\ntalking in a friend\nly manner and dur\ning the conversa\ntion Peterson jok\ningly referred to\nLiove as a royalist,\n1\nand the next be\nBert. Peterson,\nthe\nknew or saw was\nman tchose ear was\nbitten by Gallagher\nthat Gallagher\nmade a rush for\nPeterson and struck him.\nLove then\nleft the saloon.\nPeter M. Lucas, a barkeeper at the\nhotel, was next called. He said the\ntrouble started about ten o'clock.\nGallsgher had been in the barroom\nfor about an hour and during that\ntime he had several drinks, but did\nnot appear to be in a quarrelsome\nmood. Lucas was behind the bar,\nand when the trouble commenced he\nimmediately ran out in front of the\ncounter and saw Gallagher holding\nPeterson with one hand and punching\nhim with the other. A moment later\nboth men fer to the floor. The wit\nness then tried to stop the fight, but\nwas interfered with by Brown, who\nthrew him to one side, saying, ''Xjet\nthem alone; let them have a fair\nfight.\" Lucas replied that it was not\na fair fight as he (meaning Peterson),\nwas only a boy. He then appealed to\n\"Wilson, saying, \"Don't let them fight;\nhe will kill the boy.\" Wilson then\nseparated Gallagher and Peterson and\nboth men got on their feet and im\nmediately clinched again. Mr. Lewis,\nthe manager of the Hotel, then ap\npealed to the crowd to stop the fight\nand tried to get near Gallagher him\nself but was prevented from doing so7\nby Brown. The witness was not in\nthe room when the biting took place\nAfter the first interference by Wilson\nnothing was done to stop Gallagher\nfrom assaulting Peterson, and later on\nboth Wilson and Brown remarked,\n\"let them have a fair light.\" Brown\nwas walking around keeping people\naway from the two fighters. Peterson\ntook a billiard cue from Wilson and\nstarted towards Gallagher. Wilson\ntook the cue away from Peterson and\nGallagher again attacked him. Pet\nerson jumped over the table and Gal\nlagher went after him. Both fell\ndown, and Gallagher got on top of\nPeterson. I heard Peterson say some\nthing, but I could not tell whether it\nBEN GALLAGHER.\n(Front a Photograph.)\nwas an appeal for help or not. Pet\nerson got up again, and went over an\nother table. They were fighting all\nthe time, but Peterson had the worst\nof it. The next I saw of Peterson, he\npicked up a billiard ball and tried to\nthrow it at Gallagher. After that he\nran upstairs. He was badly bleeding\nand bruised. A piece was off his ear,\nfor I .saw it on the floor.\nCross-examined There were about\ntwenty people in the room when the\nfight commenced. After it was over\nthere were about fifty present. I do\nnot know what started the trouble. I\nasked Wilson to take Gallagher off,\nand he did it, but the' came together\nagain. I do not know who separated\nthem the second lime. I tiied to get\nto the center of the ring several times,\nbut each time I was pushed away by\nBrown. I did not see Peterson on top\nat any time.\nB. II. Wright was the next witness\ncalled. His testimouy was as follows:\nI\n\"I was at the Hotel on Friday even-\ning when the trouble began. I was\nwatchiug Petersonjplay a game of bil\nliards. Then I went across the room\nto watch another game. I saw Gal\nlagher strike Peterson, and saw them\nclinch. Peterson held Gallagher up\nagainst the bar. I did not see Pet\nerson strike back. I heard no\naltercation before the blow was\nstruck. Gallagher tried to pull\nPeterson away from the bar.\nThey then fell to the floor, with\nGallagher on top.. Gallagher punched\nPeterson in the head several times. I\nsaw that Peterson was getting badly\nhurt. He lay like a dead man. When\nthey first fell Gallagher bumped his\nhead against the floor. Peterson was\nface down. I did not interfere, as I\nhave had a little experience with\nthose people. I thought it dangerous.\nI appealed to a bystander to help me,\nbut he wouldn't do it. Peterson did\nnot seem to have any show, and was\nmaking no fight. I heard some one\nsay 'lie's done,1 and then I went up\nstairs and telephoned for a police\nman. Peterson had appealed for help\nseveral times, but he got none. When\nI got back Gallagher was sittingdown\nand a policeman came in. The police\nman came in. The policeman told\nGallagher to come - with him, and\nGallagher said he would not go unless\nhe had a warrant. Other people in\nthe saloon objected to Gallagher's\narrest. He was not arrested.\"\nFrank Vida testified as follows:\n\"I was playing billiards with Peter-,\nson. I had my back turned when the\nfight commenced. I turned around,\nand saw Gallagher and Peterson\nstruggling. Peterson had one hand on\nthe bar and . the other around Galla\ngher's neck. They fell to the floor.\nPeterson called for help while on the\nfloor. I wanted to help him, but I was\nprevented by someone; I do not know\nwhom. All through the fight Peter\nson was trying to defend himself from \"\nBen. Gallagher was bumping his\nhead on the floor. When they were\nseparated Peterson took a billiard cue\nand started for Gallagher. He had\ngone about six feet, when Wilson in\nterfered and took the cue from his\nhands. At this time Gallagher was\ncoming toward Peterson. When Gal\nlagher reached Peterson the cue was\nout of his hands. They began to fight\nagain. I did not see the biting, as I\nwas on the other side of the room. I\nheard Peterson call out, 'He's got my\nthumb!' He 9poke like a person who\nwas in pain. The next I saw, Peter\nson and Gallagher were against the\ntable, still fighting. Their heads were\nclose together, .Gallagher leaning over\nPeterson. Then they separated, and\nI was told that Peterson's . ear was\nbitten. I heard no altercation be\ntween Peterson and Gallagher prior\nto the fight. While they were light\ning against the billiard table they\nfell and rolled out backwards and\nPeterson kicked him.\"\nCross examination Peterson had\nonly had one drink that I know of.\nWhen he came back to the room he\nhad two bottles with him. I saw\nWilson try to separate the fighters\nOnce.\ni W. T. Monsarrat said: \"When\n'On 1 In rriicT inH Piifiircnn urora 4 r cmt )m\nagainst the table I came toward them.\nI baid: lMy God, he's got his ear in\nhis mouth.' They then broke away,\nand Gallagher spat on the table. A .\nbilliard ball came sailing in that di\nrection and I left. I do not know how\nlong Gallagher had Peterson's ear iu\nhis mouth. Gallagher spit outcome\nblood on the table. Peterson's ear\nwas bleedin. I went out then.\"\nMortimer Snow \"I was present at\nthe fight last Friday. I was upstairs\nand heard some one say there was a\nfight. I went down stairs, and as I\nentered the room I saw one man with\nanother's ear in his mouth. I did not\nknow either one. The man who was\ndoing the biting was the assailant.\nThe other man was not striking, but\nwas struggling. The cur was in the\nbiter's mouth for some time, perhaps\nhalf a minute or a minute. At that\ntime Peterson was making no de\nfense.\" No cross-examination.\nDr. C. B. Cooper \"Last Friday\nnight at the hotel I was called upon to\nattend Bert Peterson. His ear was\nbleeding; his left thumb showed\ntooth marks, two teeth were loosened\nand his eyes were badly bruised. He\nwas very much excited, but sober.\nWhile I was washing his ear, the\nwatchman brought up the missing\npiece of the ear, which I sewed on.\nThere was a small piece missing. The\near will never be as before, even if the\npiece grows on. It showed the looth\nmarks plainly, and seemed to have\nbeen chewed. It will probably cause\na disfigurement for Jife.\"\nCross-examined ,4The wounds to\nthe ear could not be caused by-com ing\ninto contact with the sharp edge of a\ntable in a fall.\"\nBert Peterson : \"I went to the hotel\nabout 9:45. I met F'rank Vida and\nplayed a game of billiards. During\nthe second game I went to the end of\nthe bar. I met a friend and while\ntalking to him I was struck several\ntime:. I jumped for my assailant and\nheld him against the bar. Someone\nthen kicked me on the leg. I let co\nof the bar anJ we airuggled into the\nmain room. We fell, I on top. Some\none kicked me again and I rolled\nover. .Gallagher was then on top,\nand was striking me. I turned no\nCharley Wilson and asked him to\ntop it. He said, 'No interference,\nfair play.' He was standing over us.\nBefore this Wilson had said, 'Kill the\nP. G spy!' 'Opium' Brown had said\nthe same thing. We were then separ\nated and I tried to get a billiard cue,\"\nbut Wilson would not permit it. Wo\nclinched again and Gallagher got my\ntiiumb in his mouth. I called for\nhelp. We fell again and Gallagher\nrolled under the table. I rose and\nkicked him. We clinched again and\nhe got my ear in his mouth. I said,\n'Ben Gallagher, If you bite my ear\nv\nft-",

D., being assistant superintendent of the\ngovernment school at that place for eight\nyears and all his life he has been prom\ninently identified with public affairs, always\nwith great credit to himself.\nMr. Phillippi is an honored member of\nthe Grand Army of the Republic, and one\nof the enjoyments which he characterizes\nas a real pleasure is meeting with the local\n\"boys in blue,\" at their eampfires at Be\nmidji. Mr. Phillippi \"saw service\" of the\ntrying kind with the Union army, and he re\nceived injuries during the great struggle\nbetween the North and the South that have\nbeen considerable trouble to him in recent\nyears.\nWhen he came to Bemidji, Mr. Phillippi\nfiled on a homestead and after he had\nproved up (four yqars ago) he took charge\nof the Beltrami county poor farm, where\nhe held the position of superintendent until\nthe present time, gaining more friends by\nthe admirable maner in which he conducted\nthe farm.\nMr. Phillippi is a progressive, liberal citi\nzen who is honored and respected by all\nwho know him, and especially is he well\nliked by his neighbors and comrades.\nINTERIOR GEO. T. BAKER & CO.'S JEWELRY STORE.\nBEMIDJI, BELTRAMI COUNTY AND NORTHERN MINNESOTA.\nM. D. STONER.\nCity Engineer Stoner, though still a\nyoung man, is one of Bemidji's oldest set\ntlers, so to speak. He settled here when\nthis city was a village, coming here from\nOiiio. He took up a timber claim in this\ncounty, and since his advent here he has\nbeen one ot the guiding factors in the city's\ndestinies. As an expert civil engineer, Mr.\nStoner has had to do with all public con\nstruction work in Bemidji he has assisted\nin building all railroads which penetrate the\ncity, and through private survey, he was\nchiefly instrumental in attracting the Great\nNorthern railroad officials, with the result\nthat they directed the main line of that\ngreat system through this city. Mr. Stoner\nalso made the preliminary survey for the\nM. & I. out of Bemidji, and the responsible\nposition of chief engineer during the con\nstruction ot the Minneapolis Red Lake and\nManitoba railroad.\nAt present, Mr. Stoner is engaged in\nbuilding twenty miles of railroad Kittson\ncounty, this state. He has located and built\nnearly all the logging spurs located on the\nM. & I. from Walker to Blackduck, and has\nbeen entrusted with numerous other im\nportant undertakings, all of which he com\npleted with comprehensive management\nand dispatch.\nAs city engineer, Mr. Stoner has made\nhimself as popular as he was when he was\nengaged in completing the extensive im\nprovements above enumerated. He is an\nadept as a surveyor and civil engineer he\nis especialy esteemed by the rank and file\nas well as by the property owners ot the\ncounty, and it is safe to predict that his\nretention in his present office is an assured\nfact so long as\"he desires to hold the same.\nGEORGE T. BAKER & CO.\nMr. Baker, the manager of this concern,\nhas been a prominent business man of\nBemidji for about five years. He is an\nother of our thrifty business men who\nsought this section owing to the glowing\nopportunities offered by its scenic beauty\nas a pleasure resort, its virgin soil, and its\nsituation as a key city. His conclusions\nalong this line have resulted in his present\npossession of the largest manufacturing\njewelry establishments and jewelry stores\nin north-central Minnesota.\nThey carry an elegant line of the popular\nmakes of watches natty things in chains,\nbracelets and jewelry novelties, rings of\nevery price, precious stones of all descrip\ntions and art goods of numerous kinds.\nThey are also experts in repair work, and\nhave every facility for disposing of such\nwork. This is evident from the fact that\nthey are official time keepers for a great\nnumber of the railroad men who reside here.\nThey also receive a vast patronage from\ntowns from all the surrounding country,\nand have earned a reputation in their\nchosen line that is to be appreciated.\nMr. Baker, the manager, is not only an\nexemplary citizen, but a prosperous one.\nHis extensive business serves as another\nexample of how business men succeed when\nthey locate here. As a member of the\nBemidji Commercial Club he shoulders his\nshare of labor in advertising the city, and\nwe are glad to mention his name in connec\ntion with other patriotic citizens who are\nresponsible for Bemidji's greatness.\nJ. PETERSON, JR.\nBemidji is also large enough to loyally\nand liberally support an exclusive confec\ntionery and fruit parlor and notion head\nquarters, which is the enterprise conducted\nby J. Peterson, Jr., the veteran confectioner\nof this city.\nMr. Peterson began his business career in\nBemidji with a small but neatly-conducted\nJ. PETERSON, JR.\nfruit and confectionery stand, which at once\nbecame popular, through the square treat\nment accorded patrons by the proprietor\nand also to the fact that nothing but the\nvery best stocks were kept on hand. After\ntwo years in the small stand, Mr. Peterson's\ntrade grew to such proportions that he was\nof necessity compelled to seek newer and\nlarger quarters, with the result that he\nleased a prominent stand in the center of\nthe business section, which he had reno\nvated and arranged especially after his own\nideas, and where he now has the most com\nplete fruit and confectionery stand-in north\ncentral Minnesota. Mr. Peterson's aim has\nalways been to excel in his particular line,\nand in his efforts he has attained a great\nmeasure of success. It is the consensus of\nopinion of those who visit Mr. Peterson's\nstore that he has the finest establishment of\nits kind in this part of the state, outside of\nDuluth.\nIn connection with the fruit and confec\ntionery business Mr. Peterson handles\ncigars and tobaccos of the best-known\nbrands, toys and books, and also conducts\nan up-to-date news stand.\nMr. Peterson has stood steadfastly by the\nmottoes which he adopted when he first en-",

I\ncould have discovered an inspicture\nif any violence had been done. The\nsafe could not be opened after the\nblow was struck, except ns I des\ncribed. After opening the safe, the\ninside was so that there evidently\niiad been violence used in opened\nthe drawers. It looked as if two\nscrew drivers had been used.

Bishop & Co. through\nthe same political mud that the Opposition\npress ' objected to its dragging\nColonel Sprpckels it has failed to con-\nrect the history of the Opposition with\nthe f.icts as alleged in its columns, as\nit has ff.iled to square the actions of its\npolitical sponsors with the ficcs of politi\ncal history. The Advertiser has failed\nin its use of every logical form to pro\ntect the false cause of the Gibson Administration\n: political induction\" hjs\nburied it; the argument of\nhas overwhelmed it ; analogy broke\nits political back, until it crawled to its\ninkstand and in utUr despair tried a\npolitical deduction, which fie w . back,\nlike a boomerang, and knocked (he\nwhole Government argument silly.\nSince last Friday the' Advertiser has\nbeen daily drivelling and laughing at\nits own 1 i in bccility.\nBy the way, gentle organ, is it not\nabout time you were fulfilling those\n-reiterated political threats of yours anent\ncertain exposures of the friends of the'\nUpposmonf You see ydu have only\none day left before the election in\nwhich to keep your word and the public\nremembers quite well that you said,\nwhen Opposition papers chaffed you,\nthat you would , do it in \"due .time,;\"\nbut then, perhaps, you meant to include\nin the little term \"due time\" a short\nperiod after election.

B. Walker.\nconcluded from yesterday's issue\nthe defense.\nII. M. Whitney, sworn: I am\nPostmaster-General. I have held\nthe position nearly three years. Mr.\nPeterson was in the office, I think,\ntwo years previously. Previous to\nthe robbery, Mr. Peterson's books\nhave not been kept with that accuracy\nI could desire ; during the past\ntwo years I several times took\nhim to task for it, how often I cannot\nsay. I do not remember of\never charging him with his books\nbeing inaccurate as well as behind\nlninri, but I did not considor tllem\nkept as accurately as they might. I\ndo not think I said anything to him\nbefore the rdbbery thai would lead to\nhis being uueasy or distuibed about\nthe matter.\nCross-examination by Attorney-tGener.il:\nI was aware that the\nAuditor-General was having an examination\nmade of accounts in all\nthe departments. Mr. Peterson's\nbooks were examined by the Auditor-General,\nMr. Walker. Mr.\nWalker looked through the books,\naie appeared to be satisfied. He\nsaid he had found nothing in the\nbooks so far as he had examined to\nwhich he could take exception.\nP. O'Suu.ivAh, sworn : Mr. Peterson\nremained upstairs a portion of the\nday in the barkeeper's room, one\nday about the middle of the week\nprevious to Mr. Walker being arrested.\nI went up and said, Mr.\nPeterson, why don't you go home.\nHe said I'm rcstiug; ray wife thinks\nI'm on my way to San Francisco,\nI said, what would you go to 'Frisco\nfor. Ho said, I'm bothered about\nthis business. I said, You better go\nhome, if you go to 'Frisco, people\nwill think you committed the robbery\nyourself.\nMns. Jackson, sworn : Wo llvo\nnext house to the Post Office. I was\nliving there the night of the robbery.\nI remember tlio occasion. I heard\nparties going in and out, doors open\ning and closing, and footsteps on\nthe side walk. Tho hour was shortly\nafter three o'clock. The footsteps\nI heard come out of the office were\nvery light. I have knoivn Mr.\nPeterson by sight for tho past three\nyears. I heard a carriage that I\nthought drove past our house. It\nwas going very slowly. Could not\ntell how many people there were. I\nhi aril like the voices of two persons\nconversing together. I fix the hour\nby having heard the clock striko\nthree. Tho footsteps seemed to\ncomo from the side door, At different\ntimes, I had heard persons come\nput of the Post Office and walk, between\n8 and 4 o'clock in the morning,\nI have often noticed Mr.\nPeterson wealing a sort of low shoo\nor slipper.\nCross-examination: About 3 weeks\nbBforo the robbery I heard a carriage\ncome down and stop, as it\nMl .U..-M\n'\"' \"V \"\nDAILY HONOLULU PRESS, TUESDAY, FEBRUARY 2, 1886.\nseemed, at the corner of our house,\nbut heard no voices.\nGeorge Dunn, sworn: I am h\npractical machinist. I was in the\nAnchor Saloon when Mr. Petorson\noamc in. Mr. Walker was thcro.\nlib offered Mr. Petersou a drink of\nWine. Somo jovial remarks wore\npassed between Mr. Peterson, Sullivan\nand Walker. Thcro was some\nconfusion got up elsewhere, and Mr.\nPeterson went out. I heard all that\nWalker said to Peterson on that occasion.\nWalker was boisterous.\nEverybody could hear him. At tho\ntime Walker spoke to Peterson, the\nlatter had .not drunk his beer.\nWalker was standing near Peterson\nwhen he spoko to him. Mr, Sullivan\nseemed t6 have heard them, for\nhe was waiting as if wanting to see if\nMr. Peterson would take wine. I\nhad not met Mr. Walker there that\nday before. I came back to Honolulu\nfrom Paia Plantation two\nmonths ago. I had had two drinks\nwith Mr. Walker there that day.\nWalker stayed there till about half-past\n11 or 12. I did not think\nWalker whispered to Mr, Peterson.\nI could not tell whether Mr. Walker\nspoko to Mr. Peterson or not. He\nmight have done so in a very low tone\nof voice without my knowing it. (The\nabove includes Mr. Dunn's evidence\nboth on direct and cross-examination).\n,\nMr. Doyle, sworn : On the second\nJanuary, I was\" at work at Mr.\nNowlein's place, on King street. Mr\nWalker was in thero that evening a\nlittle after nine o'clock. lie was\nthere until after ten o'clock. Ho\nsaid he was lookinj for a man of the\nname of Murray. He returnep again\nabout half-past ten. Left about a\nquarter to eleven. He remarked it\nwas time to close up. They were\nall strangers, sea-faring men, in the\nsaloon. Joe, a Portuguese, was\nthere when Mr. Walker came. Mr.\nWalker was then drinking with some\nmen and Officers of the bark Hesper.\nJoe waited on Mr. Walker. I was\noutside the bar, taking a drink with\nthem. I worked inside at tho bar\nthat evening of t an hour. I never\nleft the barroom that night. I know\nit was after nine, by the time Joe\ncame off the watch, I could not tell\nhow many drinks Walker took there.\nI am quite certain, Mr. Walker\nstayed there till after ten. I was\nnot out of the saloon between 8 and\nII o'clock. He came back again\nabout half-past ten. He was there\ntill about a quarter to eleven. He\ncame in alone.\nMr. It. S. Sorimgeour, sworn : I\nremember the night of the Post\nOffice robbery. Between 10:20 and\n11:15 I saw Mr. Peterson on the\nvacant lot where the Advertiser\noffice used to be. He was conversing\nwith two men ; they were about\nsix feet from the street ; I did not\nobserve them more than half a\nminute; his condition was argumentative;\none of the men said\n\"good evening,\" I merely said\n\"good evening\" and passed on.\nCross-examined by Attorney-General:\nI fix the time by having\nheard of the robbery next morning.\nI know I left the coffee saloon\nilO :20, because I heard of the\nnext day, and remembered of\nhaving seen Peterson, and this naturally\nmade me try to recall the\nhour. I had not been drinking that\nevening.\nTun Defendant, sworn : I have\nbeen acquainted with Mr. Peterson\nabout a year. My business is bricklayer.\nDuring the past eight mouths\nI have been engaged as manager of\nthe Royal Saloon. Mr. Peterson\ncame in there frequently. Hi; took\nbeer principally. lie came in two\nor three times a day to my knowledge.\nHe would talk to me ; pass\ntho time of the day, and so on. He\nwould often talk about different\nfamily troubles. About the conversation\nsix months ago referred to\nby Mr. Peterson, I met him in the\nmorning near tho Bethel Church.\nI told hiin he did not look well.\nWhat was the cause of it? He said\nhe had a good deal of bother on his\nmind. I never mentioned anything\nto him about the Post Office. I\noften heard liim talk about the condition\nof his books. He said Mr.\nWhitney might shove him out of\nthere ; that he didn't like Mr. Whitney\nand Mr. Whitney didn't like\nhim. He said his books were away\nbehind. On Saturday night, the\n2nd January, Mr. Peterson came\nin atjout. 8 o'clock. I came from\nbehind tho bar to play a game;\nafter a while Mr. Sharratt came in ;\nMr. Sharratt asked him to come in\nand take a drink, and asked me to\ncome too. Mr. Sharratt said he\nwould like a hack to go home. I\nemployed a hack. Mr, Peterson\ngot in with him. Mr. Sharratt\nordered three bottles of beer, which\nI got and put in the hack. I had\nno other conversation with Peterson,\nat that time. Peterson was in later\non. Mr. Peterson pulled my coat\nand walked towaids the little room ;\nhe began to tell me about his books\nagain. Ho appeared very much\nexcited; called for a drink; he\nwished to God ho was dead; ho\nwould leavo the door opened if somebody\ncould come and take his books\naway; Mr. Whitney was coming\ndown in the morning; I said,\nQ bosh, don't talk like that.\nThis was after 10 o'clock. Just\nthen a man camo to the door, saw\nub in, drew back again. That was\nall the conversation at that time. I\ndd not uudertake to desttoy his\nbooks. 1 did not tell him I would\nblow up the safe with dynamite,\ntlat is a tiling I know nothing about,\nexcept what I have read. Wo got\nup and went put. At the door, ho\nturned in the direction of the Post\nOffice, and\nL went up to tho Mer\nchant's ExclJingc (Nowloin's). I do\nnot know wh tho person wns who\nhad come to ho door when wo were\nspeaking. Ientto Nowlein's to sco\ntwo follows that had come on a\nvessel from Jio place I came from\nmyself. I w ntcd to sco tho captain\nof tho Lizzie, Lredalc I did not go to\nthe Post Offi :o between those times.\nAfter leaving Nowlein's, I went down\nto the Royjil Saloon by Nuuanu\nstreet. Whei'I got back, one of\ntho back doois was closed. When I\ngot hack Has io was there. I had\nbeen to his pi tco the foro part of the\nevening. He wanted to know if I\nwould let hhr havO the glass of his\nlantern, that ! held, also two bottles\nof liquor, nnc' he would pay me his\nformer bill, a so for the two Dottles\non Monday I let him have the\nliquor and ic glass. 1 tlien put\nout tho lights Took the cash into\nthe back room about 11 . o'clock.\nCounted the money, made a note of\nit, and put It in the safe. I then\nwent upstairs I noxt we'nt out between\n1 and 2 o'clock next afternoon.\nWhen 1 went upstairs, I\nwent to bed. I know nothing at all\nabout that robbery at the Post\nOffice.\nby the Attorney-General:\nWhen I went to call that\nhack for Sharratt it was between 8\nand 9. After Sharratt and Peterson\nleft, I stopped about the barroom.\nI usually take a tun round every\nSaturday night to see if anything\nhad not been paid. I stayed a few\nminuiesiat the Empire Saloon. I\nwent acrbss from thero to the Cosmopolitan,\nbut did not go in ; from there\nI went as; far as the Commercial. I\ndid not stop there more than five\nminutes. From there I came down\npast Fort-street church to Dodd's. I\nwent in there. I stayed there 10\nminutes to a quarter of an hour. I\nhad a dink there; I went from\nthere to the Koystone, stayed there\nabout three or four minutes, spoke\nto Mr. Velsh, and others that I\nknew ; I then called at Hastie's, I\nstayed there 2 or 3 minutes, asked\nHastie if lie had any money for me\nthat he ow'ed mo ; I called him out\nand aked him on the side walk; he\nsaid ho hadn't, asked me to lei\nhim have his glass, that his wife had\ngot tho consent of the Y. M. C. A.\nto have a show, that he was to give\ntho show oi the nuxt week ; there\nwas nothing else said ; the conversation\nlasted about a couple of\nminutes. I went from there down\nto the Royal Saloon, thiough Bethel\nstreet, went straight to the saloon ;\nit was close on 9 o'clock. I had\nloaned Hastie 25 on the glass. It\nwas a magnifying glass. I gave him\nthe money some four months ago\nwhen he had the shooting gallery. I\nhail let him have the shooting gallery\nat $15 a week. He owed me 45\nfor rent. He carried it on some\nthree months after I went to the\nRoyal. When I loaned him the $25\nhe had the shooting gallery about 2J\nmonths. lie owed me altogether\nnearly 70. When I returned from\nthis conversation with Hastie tw 0 or\nthree strangers were in the room ; I\nremnined there a quaiterof an hour;\nnone whom I knew came in while I\nwas there ; I went from there to\nMerchant's Exchange; met a man\nnamed Schwartz opposite Afong's,\nand talked with him about two\nminutes ; met persons I was looking\nfor at Merchant's Exchange ; they\nbelonged to bark Lizzie Iredale ; I\nstopped with them until ten or\nthereabout. Between 7 and 8 that\nevening I was behind the bar at my\nown place; took my supper at G\no'clock; did not go out anywhere\nbetween 7 and 8. I do not know\nof anything happening between 7 and\n8 ; must have been after 8 that\nPeterson came ; ho did not stay\nlong ; Sharratt asked him and me to\ntake a drink; he had been there\nabout half an hour before Peterson\ncame ; it was about ten minutes\nafter 8 that I called the express for\nSharratt ; I always do have wagons\ndrive to back yard ; Mr. Sharratt\nhad a little more than usual in hiin\nthat night, and I did not want him\nto go out in that state. Came down\nfrom Exchange directly to saloon;\ndid not meot anyone in particular\non the way down ; was alone ; told\nthese men to stop, as I would be\nback ; could not have been more\nthan two or three minutes after 10 ;\nstayed at saloon till nearly half-past\n10. Mr. Peterson came in after I\nhad boon there a while; after we\nwent in back room together he pulled\nme by tho coat ; all tlio conversation\nabout the books and wanting t,o die\ntook place in those two or three\nminutes; must have been between\n10 and half-past. I left saloon with\nPeterson by the same door, the one\nfacing on Merchant street. I bade\nhim goodnight, and I went up\nstreet to Merchant's Exchange,\nwhere I had promised io meet those\nmen again. The glass Hastio pawned\nwith mo I kept in small drawer in\nBafo ; I gave it to him that evening\nafter I closed saloon, very nearly\n11; one back door was open, although\nI had not shut tho gates.\nThat day I took in altogether over\n8200 ; Hastie was not there when I\ncounted it. While I was in back\nroom with Peterson someone enme\nto back door, muttered something,\nand withdrew. Back door leads to\nyard, that is fenced, a small gate\nleading to Nuuanu street. That is\nnot tho door customers usually\ncomo ; there aro threo doors. It is\ncommon for people to conic to back,\nto see who is in saloon. I have had\nwomen come there, to soe if their\nhusbands aro there, and rush away\nlike a flash of lightning. Last time\nI was in saloon, stayed about twenty\nminutes, and left alone; did not\nmeet nnyono on way down. Peterson\nnever told mo he left tho doors\nopen. When ho pulled my coat ho\nsaid his books wero in such a condition;\nlie said nothing cbout leaving\ndoors open ; am sure ho said nothing\nof the kind. 1 could not have said\nso in my direct examination. Mr.\nPeterson got a chair and beckoned\nfor me to sit down ; I noticed he\nwas very much excited ; and shaky ;\nI had beer but do not rcmombor\nwhat he had. Ho said : \"The trouble\nIs this: my books aro in such a\nbad state that I do not know what\nto do ; I wish I was dead.\" I asked\nwhat was the matter with his books,\nand ho told mo ho had not time to\nrectify them, and Mr. Whitney was\ncoming down Sunday morning. He\ndid not like Mr. Whitney, and knew\nMr. W. did not like him. I said,\n\"Oh bosh I\" Just then tho footstep\ncame to the door. I said that\nbecauso he was so excited. I am\nquite sure Petorson did not say he\nwished somebody would go through\nthe Post Office. The money borrowed\nwas not from me but from\nray wife. One evening the dog\nbarked at end of ray verandah, on\nBeretania street, and my wife went\nout and met Mr. Peterson. Ho asked\nif Mr. Cummins lived there, and\nmy wife said no. I also went out,\nand spoke to him ; he said he wanted\nto see Mr. Cummins on some little\nbusiness; he had heard Mr. C.'s\nclerk at Waimanalo was coming up\nto go into Mr. Boltc's office; he\nwould like to see if there was any\npossible chance for him (P.) to get\nemployment on the plantation. I\nsaid 1 had heard nothing about\nclerk leaving. He started to go\naway, but after going a . fow\nsteps camo back, and said there\nwas one little thing he wanted to\nask Mr. C. 5 he wanted to know if\nhe would let him havo $G00 or $700,\nas ho was in difficulty, and it was\nnear end of quarter ; asked me if I\nwould not speak to Mr. C. about\ngetting this money. I said I would\nnot like to ask Mr. C. anything like\nthat, as ho had given himself and\nwife $100 each, and tho children\n$10 each, as Christinas presents,\nlie went away, saying he might be\nback in a short time. This was\nail ; it took place about two weeks\nago. I did not lend him the money,\nlie called again I think on the\n13th and asked if Mr. Cummins\nhad come over, or if she had ascertained\nwhen he would come. He\nspoke chiefly to my wife on this\noccasion, talking about his family,\nand saying if anyone lent him this\nmoney he would return it in about\nsix months. My wife said: \"As\nyou are in such pilikia, I have a\nlittle money belonging to the children,\nbut not as much as you\n$400 or $500. Walker\nspent $300 fitting up that place on\nKing street, which has lost money ;\nbut I can let you have $400, if that\nwill do.\" Peterson thought it would,\nand he and my wife went into the\nparlor, where she gave him the\nmoney, he promising to pay her $4\na month. He drew out a note. I\ndid not advise her to lend the money\nbut told her she could please herself.\nShe said she knew Mr. Peterson's\nfamily a long time, especially\nthe daughter. I did not say anything\nto my wife about Peterson's\ndifficulties ; he spoke about danger\nof losing his place on his first visit.\nHad heard about Post Office robbery,\nbut nothing but outside talk\npointing suspicion at anybody ; had\nnot suspicion of Peterson myself,\nalthough ho had spoken to me about\nbooks. I do not think anybody\ncould have heard our conversation\nin back room ; a person would havo\nto be right at the door to hear. After\nI called on Hastie, on sidewalk, I\ncame right down to Royal Saloon ;\nHastie said he would be down there.\nBy Mr. Hatch, with permission of\nCrown and Court At Anchor Saloon,\na week after robbery, I was there,\ntalking with Sullivan the bar-keeper\nand some others. Sullivan said he\ncould give a bottle between us, I\nasked Peterson, who came in afterward,\nif he would have wine. He\nsaid no, as beer and wine would not\nmix. I was pretty \"comfortable\"\nthat morning. I met Dunn that\nmorning, and treated him at two or\nthree places ; he did not treat at all.\nMrs. Thos. B. Walker, sworn:\nWe have been married over six\nyeara. I remember night when\nPost Office was robbed ; were living\nthen above Royal Saloop ; saw Mr.\nWalker that evening; went down\nabout 5 minutes past 11, when he\nwas counting money received that\nday ; when done counting money he\nlocked door and we both went up\nstairs; from that time we never\nwent out of yard till between one\nand two on Sunday afternoon. We\nboth occupied same room. I was\nnever acquainted intimately with\nPeterson; havo only known his\ndaughter, could not say exactly how\nlong, about 8 or 11 years. I remember\nPeterson coining twice to\nour house on Beretania street; first\ntime asked if my father lived there ;\ntold him ho lived on King street.\nHe said Mr. Whitney and he did\nnot get along well together, and he\nwanted to get a place on my father's\nplantation. He came again three or\nfour nights after; he was pretty\nnervous ; I asked him to sit down,\nwhich ho did ; he asked mo when\nmy fathor would be down ; said he\nwould like to borrow $G00 or $700\nfrom my father. I told him I could\nlend him $400 or $500 if ho would\npay it back within six months ; he\nsaid ho would, and promised $4 a\nmonth interest on it ; ho wrote out\na note 5 tho money I let hirn have\nbelonged to ray children ; it was\ngiven little by little by my father\nand others. My husband did not\nconsent, bnt I gave tho money because\nI know Peterson's daughter,\nand felt bad becauso of what he told\nmo about his family. I kept the\nmoney ; my husband had nothing to\ndo with it.\nby Attorney-General\n: I do not know of my husband\nhaving been from home after 11\no'clock, or a little after, since he\nhas been keeping the Royal. Mr.\nPeterson spoke about wanting money\non his two visits ; it was three or\nfour days after lfo first camo that I\ngave him tlio money. Never havo\nbeen long in company with Peter\nson's daughter, I presume all Mr.\nCummins' friends know ho lives on\nKing street ; ho has been there about\ntwo years. It was on occasion of\nPeterson's visit, after ho left, that\nWalker objected to my lending the\nmoney\nA. Carter, sworn : I had a conversation\nwith Mr. Peterson nbOiit P.O.\nrobbery since its occurrence ; have\nbeen acquainted with him, intimately,\nsince he cntne to the country.\nThe conversation was lieforc lliu examination\nin tho Police Couit.\n(Tho Attorney-General objects to\na question as to the nature of the\nconversation, and the Court sustains\nthe objection, on tho ground that\nPeterson could not bo discredited\niiow when ho had not been asked\nregarding this conversation on his\ncross-examination. )\nMr. Hatch submits, in the absence\nof Justice Bickerton, by permission\nof the Court and consent of\nthe Crown, the evidence of I. B.\nPeterson at the preliminary examination\nin the Police Court.\nAt six o'clock the defense rested,\nand a recess of an hour and a quarter\nwas taken.\nafter recess.\nThe Court resumed at 7:15 p. in.\nMr. F. M. Hatch addressed the jury\nin behalf of defendant, and claimed\nthat the evidence presented by the\nCrown was insufficient to convict,\ntho only point made being that the\ndefendant had been furnished with\nsuch information as would tender it\npossible for him to commit the\noffense.\nHis Excellency the Attorney-General\naddressed the jury on behalf\nof the Crown, claiming that Mr.\nPeterson's evidence was reliable,\nand that there was a hiatus between\ntho hours of 10 and 11 o'clock on\nthat Saturday night, in the alibi\nattempted to be proven by the defense.\nHe said he did not believe\nthat Walker was not out of his house\nafter 11 at night for four months,\nand he did not believe that when all\nthe telephone bells in the town were\nringing with the news, and everybody\ntalking about it, that Mr.\nWalker remained quietly and privately\nin his house until between 1\nand 2 o'clock in the afternoon. He\ntook Mr. Peterson's evidence to be\ntrue from A all the way down to Z.\nAs to Mr. Dunn's evidence, he\nthought, \"Dunn won't do.\"\nHastie, ho thought, was well\nnamed, from the haste with which\nhe left tho country. He thought\nMr. Walker should suffer, if for\nnothing else, if he was Mr. Peterson's\nfriend that night, he should\nhave taken care of him ; if not his\nfriend, he should have reported him\nto the authorities. Ho did not ask\nthe jury to convict on the uncorroborated\nevidence of Mr. Peterson,\nbut he held that Mr. Peterson was\nstrongly corroborated in three very\nimportant particulars : (1) Mr.\nWalker's saying nothing when Mr.\nPeterson proposed to destroy his\nbooks; (2) his being with Mr.\nPeterson immediately before tho\ncrime; and (3) the matter of the\nmoney borrowed from Mrs. Walker.\nMr. Justice Preston said the\nprisoner was charged under Chap.\n14, sees. 1G and 17, Penal Code,\nwhich stated that whoever in the\nnight enters, or breaks and enters\nany building used for public purposes,\nwith intent to commit a felony\ntherein, shall be punished by imprisonment,\netc. It was immaterial\nin this case whether Walker took this\nmoney or not; if he entered this\nplace, whether with guilty intent or\nnot, he is guilty. If he went in to\nsteal those books he is guilty under\nthis act. The removal of those\nbooks would be a felony. The testimony\nof Peterson was direct and\npositive, and you will bear in mind\nthat the suggestion was made by\nWalker not only then, but on a previous\noccasion. Walker snid on his\ndirect examination that Peterson\ntold him the state of affairs:\n\"I had como from behind tho\nbar; Sharratt came in\" then ho\nnarrates how Sharratt went away\n\"I went out with Peterson; he\nwalked about the little room;\nhe got excited ; wished ho was dead ;\nhe would leave tho doors open ; I\nanswered, 'Oh bosh!' \" If he said\nso it is as strong corroboration of\nPeterson's evidence as any you can\nhavo. Whether there aro any other\ncircumstances of corroboration it is\nfor you to say ; in my opinion ho is\ncorroborated. What can you think\nof a mau who said that in that box\nand half an hour afterward denied\nit? Is ho worthy of belief? If it is\ntrue that Walker said that he had a\nthousand dollars for him it is important.\nIt is possible Walker\nmight havo whispered to him with-out\ntho having heard it\nThere was no doubt Peterson was in\nthe Roynl Saloon; that he went\ninto tho little room and had a drink\nwith Walker. People aro often\nmistaken as to the oxact time of an\noccurrence. How does Walker account\nfor himself when he last went\nout of the saloon that night? lie is\nable to tell you at what house he\nstopped ; ho wont to tho Merchant's\nExchange to look for a friend ono\nof tho crow of the Lizzie Ircdalo ; ho\nwent away at ajjquarter to eleven.\nIlls II6nor comincnted on the\nto Hastio being at tho\nMcrcianfs Exchange Saloon a littlo\nbefore 11, lcavijig to go to sec\nWalker and beihg at tho Royal\nSaloon a littlo lifter 11. It was\nclear that Peterson and Walker had\nleft the Royal togcthor. According\nto Peterson, Walker went to tho Post\nOffice and was let in by Peterson\nin nnswer to his knock. If a man\nis let in by an accomplice it is breaking\nin. The next thing wo hear of\nWalker he Is at the Merchant's Exchange.\nI think it is fair to as-sumo\nthat there was time ami opportunity\nto commit that offense\ntho time ho left the Merchant's\nExchange 11 nd got back after 11.\nThe proof of an alibi must be clear\nand connected. Mrs. Jackson's and\nMr. Melu ten's evidence wns briefly\ncommented upon to show how important\nlittle things were in such a\ncase. Mr. Scringeour might have\nseen Peterson talking with a man,\nbut it would have been much more\nsatisfactory if that man had been\npioducudthnt is if there was anything\nIn it. Peterson snys he\ndid not speak to anybody at tho\nplace indicated that night,\nbut is that important? Peterson\ncould not havo been in a very bad\nstale when he took Sharratt home.\nHis Honor again spoko of tho difficulty\nof people stating the time of\nevents fiom memory. Peterson tells\nyou that after leaving Walker at the\nAnchor saloon ho then went home ;\na haekman proves that he took Hira\nhome. Why should Peterson and\nWalker have a conversation about\nthose books Peterson said they had\na talk six months ago. With regard\ntfy tho loan of Mrs. Walker thero is\nspmething strange. Mr. Walker,\nwith his knowlcdgo of Peterson's\ndifficulties 'With the\" lattcr'a 6ffer to\nleave the safe open allowed his\nwife to loan him her children's\nnjioney. What can wo think when\nwe come to compare conduct of a\nman v?hb would allow his wife to\nlend a man her children's money\nwithout nuyJiope of his ever paying\nit? With regard to Peterson's statement,\nif there is any corroborative\ntestimony you will believe it, and\ntherd is no other alternative but to\nbring in a verdict of guilty. If\nyou find that ho entered tho Post\nQfileo ,with guilty intent you\nmust find him guilty. If Walker\nhas accounted for his conduct on\ntiiat occasion you must give him the\nbenefit of it. It must be a reasonable\ndoubt. The Crown must make\nout their case. They have charged\nWalker with a felony, and you must\nfind if they have made it out. It is\nyour duty to render such a verdict\nthat you may go home to your beds\nand feel that you have done right. In\nsmall communities it is hard for a\nCourt and jury to pass upon people\nWhom we know well. If you think\nifj is not possible that the robbery\nwas not committed before 11, it is\nfor you to say whether Mrs. Walker\nis, to be believed. His Honor, in\nclosing, commented on the folly of\nl'eterson's object of having the\nbpoks destroyed ; saying, very fow\nrrjen who commit crime ever\nthink of the consequences. If they\ndd, thero would be very much less\ncrime committed.\nThe jury retired at about 9:40, and\nat 11:20 sent in a message that they\ncould not a.ree. Being called ,mto\nCourt, they were, after a short colloquy,\nwith the Judge, recommended, by\nHisHHonor to try once more. They\nreturned at 11:42 and reported disagreement\nstill, and were discharged.\nHis Honor then fixed' defendant's\"\nbail at $5,000, with two sureties in\n$2,500, additional, each.\nitcto JSbcrtiecmcttte.\nThe White House.\nNo. 118 Nuuanu Seet, Honolulu, between\nand Kukui.Strtm.\nMrs. J.

The stock of goods in\nthese stores is as complete as one\nwould expect to find in a much\nlarger city.\nTHE MAMMOTH PLANT OF THE STANWOOD LUMBER COMPANY, WHICH ADDS MATERIALLY TO STANWOOD'S PAYROLL.\nSTANWOOD LUMBER CO.\nIn addition to being an agricultural cen\nter, Stanwood is also an important milling\ntown. The Stanwood Lumber Co.'s plant in\nthis city is one of the largest mills in Sno\nhomish County. It employs many men and\nadds very substantially to Stanwood's an\nnual payroll.

One thing that im\npresses the stranger who goes to\nArlington is the number of fine\nstores of every sort. As the lead\ning pharmacy in the city, the Owl\nPharmacy certainly does its part\nin carrying out this impression.\nTHE PALACE HOTEL.\nThe person going to Stanwood may feol\nsure of good hotel accommodation. The\nPalace Hotel in this city is a popular and\nreasonably priced hostelry with modern con\nveniences and good accommodations. It\nis a popular stopping place for commercial\ntravelers and for hunters who come to the\nStanwood flats after ducks.",
